## üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Lazybark<br>
I‚Äôm a middle Golang developer and creative coder interested in microservices, webtech, messengers, cryptography and neural networks.<br>
My main mission is to create fast and simple solution for every task I face, so I like to perform experiments and never afraid of getting through someone else's code.<br>
Also I write fiction books in russian <a href="https://sergey-krekhno.ru/books/cydonian_girl/">![](https://img.shields.io/badge/website-link?style=social&logo=Google%20Chrome)</a>
